# MyMontessoriChildDownloader

Download observations from MyMontessoriChild and format them for printing into a booklet

Run the tool from the command line. It will ask for your username and password for https://www.mymontessorichild.com/parents.

The tool downloads the observation text and photos (in the highest resolution I could find) and creates an HTML file which you can open in a browser and print.

Note that the HTML is not intended do (and does not!) look good on the screen. Print (or print preview) it with paper size A5 to see it as intended.
